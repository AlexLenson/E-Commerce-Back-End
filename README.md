# E-Commerce-Back-End
## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The server uses a working Express.js API with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
- Database is seeded with categories, products, product-tags, and tag data
- Routes are added in order to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to query the database
